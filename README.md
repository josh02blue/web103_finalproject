## About

### Description and Purpose

CampusConnect is a web and mobile app designed to help college students stay connected to campus events, study groups, and resources. It simplifies event discovery, allows students to RSVP and receive reminders, and provides an interactive map of upcoming events across campus. The purpose of the app is to improve student engagement and help users find academic and social opportunities easily.

### Inspiration

I was inspired by how easy it is to miss out on events, study sessions, or workshops simply because information is scattered across multiple platforms. My goal was to create one centralized app where students can find everything happening on campus in one place â€” like a digital community hub for student life.
