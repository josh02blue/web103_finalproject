## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Even though I wasn’t able to meet with my team, I made good progress independently. I carefully reviewed all requirements, brainstormed app ideas, and drafted the ReadMe and user stories so I can contribute effectively once our team syncs up. I also gained a solid understanding of the features we’ll need to implement and started organizing how our project could be structured.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main challenge was coordinating schedules — we weren’t able to hold a full team meeting this unit. That made it harder to divide roles, confirm feature ideas, and ensure that everyone was on the same page. Without direct collaboration, progress felt slower and less connected, though communication via messages helped a bit.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I’ll need guidance on re-aligning with my teammates to merge our individual contributions smoothly. Some support with using GitHub collaboratively and resolving merge conflicts would also help. Additionally, feedback on our planned features and database structure would ensure we’re building our app efficiently and meeting all requirements before development starts.
